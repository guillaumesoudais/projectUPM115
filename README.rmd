# Escaping Robot (UPM115 Project)

## Introduction 

The aim of the project is to make a robot that is able to find the exit of a maze. 
The strategy of the robot is to take the direction that is on the most on the left. 
For that we will use a ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor to find this direction and two motors for the two wheels of the robot. 
If we have enough time, we can make this robot to map the maze itâ€™s in.

## General architecture of the project

The project will have the following modules :
- The movement module which is the module that makes the robot moving. Its entry points are the direction and speed commands
- The sonar module which detects obstacles. Its entry points are angles for the servo motor and it must send the distance of the obstacle to the command module
- The command module which receive information from the sonar and decide of the direction and speed of the robot as well as its sonar orientation
Optional modules (if we have enough time) :
- The mapping module : receives information from the servo and the command module to record obstacle position

## Stages of the project

To realise this project we will use an incremental method. Below are the stages of the project:
- Realizing the movement module : add a few tests function with recorded moves to verify that the module is working
- Realizing the sonar module : same principle as previous step
- Realizing the command module
Optional steps (if we have enough time) :
- Mapping the path of the robot : be able to deduce the path of the robot from the commands of the wheels (admitting it will not slide)
- Mapping the obstacle : from the position of the robot obtained in the previous step and the position of the obstacle, mapping the obstacles of the maze
- Find a shorter path : after mapping the path of the robot, deduce a shorter path by eliminating dead-ends
